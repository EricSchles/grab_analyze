HERE'S WHAT SOME OF MY STUDENTS HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT ME: [Please note: All testimonials have been edited for grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc.] "I could never have imagined I would find such an enthusiastic, interesting, and wise person when I first contacted James. Meeting James has been a powerful experience for me, both in terms of my English and my life. He has been the most dedicated, patient, and efficient English teacher I have ever had. After two classes in Cambridge, we have continued on Skype. Never before have I improved so much in terms of conversation skills and in the understanding of the English language in all its aspects. With new techniques and different teaching approaches, he has found a way to engage me in the learning process and to make me desire and love every moment I spend surrounded by English. "This is not about spending hours in front of boring and inanimate books anymore and has become a complete, fun, and more intuitive process, in which we focus on those weaker aspects of my current knowledge as they come up. The teaching has been individualized based on the different aspects I lack. Besides that, learning doesn't finish every time James' face fades away on my computer screen at the end of our Skype classes. James sends interesting and well-structured materials for me to work with at home and has given me pieces of advice regarding different activities related to English that have helped me to improve at my own speed. Our classes are definitely worth every dollar I pay for them." -- Pablo, Spain "I had learned English for a long time before I met James, but I could not make a real leap in speaking English. I would strongly recommend James to those of you who seriously want to improve your English. In the time I have been working with him, first with classes in Cambridge and now from South Korea on Skype, my English skills have definitely improved. He helps his students in so many different ways and provides continual support that goes beyond the classroom. After I started working with James soon after I arrived in the U.S., he began to show me effective ways to advance my English to higher and higher levels. He also closely guided me. He is not an ordinary teacher, and his class is not just about learning grammar and expressions. His teaching methods are customized and have evolved depending on my progress. He has further helped me cultivate more natural American rhythms and accents, which no other teachers could do in the past. If you choose James, you will have a great teacher and maybe even a trusted friend at the same time!" -- Hessung, South Korea "I worked with James for over a year. He was not only an excellent English teacher but also a life coach who helped me to overcome challenges in my work and in my life. I really appreciate what he taught me over the time we worked together. You will get more than you expect when you learn English with James." -- Tiffany, Taiwan "After a long period of taking private lessons with my teacher and friend, James, I can say that he is the best teacher in the world! He not only seemed to have answers to everything, but was also able to maintain a high level of energy, creativity, and enthusiasm. He knew exactly what I needed, and he explained everything so amazingly well that I understood everything he taught me very quickly. I learned so much about English from James and also how to improve my English outside of class. The materials he created and the regular attention he gave me outside of class also helped me a lot. I really looked forward to going to his classes every week!" -- Amador, Spain "I sincerely recommend James, a wonderful teacher not only in English but also in life guidance, to all who seek to improve English skills and/or who are eager to understand American culture and history. James has incredible cultural sensitivity and intellectual diversity as well as passion and patience in teaching. I have benefited tremendously from James in accent reduction, speaking/listening comprehension, and presentation skills (just to name three areas) since we started classes a while back. I have heartfelt gratitude to James for his continuing energy in teaching and for guiding me in many aspects, levels, and stages of life." -- Ching-Fu, Taiwan "James is an extraordinary teacher, providing a professional teaching approach combined with a fun working atmosphere. He easily identified my weak spots and came up with an individual approach to address these issues and resolve them. He is very motivating, encouraging, creative, highly skilled, and energetic, offering not only English lessons but learning for life as well. I enjoyed this holistic approach, benefitting from a unique teaching material data base which he created all by himself and which is still available to me now, even after I have finished classes. He is simply a great teacher, which you need to experience for yourself. Words can't explain." -- Jrgen, Germany "Working with James was the best investment I made while I was in Boston for a year. When I arrived, I had a lot of problems speaking English. I also had major problems with pronunciation and grammar. When I started working with James, he immediately began to help me to prioritize my learning process. He also challenged me in the right way to reach my very high goals. I felt that James helped me every second I was with him, and even when I was not in private class with him! When I had to prepare for presentations for my professional work, James gave me very valuable tips that made a big difference. He has a lot of experience in public speaking. Definitively, I can say that I got a big return on my investment. Now that I am back in Spain, I still work with James -- on Skype!" -- Ignacio, Spain Rates for One-on-One Private Lessons: $65/hour $105/two-hour session (You will receive a LOWER RATE for prepaid lessons scheduled in advance. Longer sessions available. Both in-person and Skype classes are intensive, so the rates are the same.)

Richard Barnet has his own approach to drawing and figure constructionThis can be useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. The interplay between imagination and observation is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements He demonstrates contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationaly as well as to those working abstractly. Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists.  As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       I am currently offering classes in Wing Chun Kung-Fu in Midtown Manhattan. Because of the private/semi-private training environment and limited space, enrollment is extremely limited. In addition, because of the seriousness of the training, anyone inquiring must be over 18 years old to apply, SORRY NO EXCEPTIONS. Everyone will be carefully screened through an initial interview and then placed in a six-month probationary training period before being accepted. I am looking for serious, non-egotistical, dedicated individuals who are willing to devote themselves and put in 100% effort in their training. I have been studying Wing Chun under Sifu Michael Militano for over 20 years, training under him consistently since March 1993. Class schedule is as follows:Monday 6:00pm - 7:00pmWednesday 6:00pm - 7:00pmSaturday 12:00pm - 1:00pmSunday 2:00pm - 3:00pmThere are no contracts to sign, classes are $150 a monthAnyone interested can contact me using the e-mail address above to schedule an appointment to try your first class or if you need more information. Responding with an intelligent, honest and caring reply takes time and energy. We don't like to waste either. Before clicking on the link above, please ask yourself (and answer honestly) whether you are planning to ask a question that you can answer yourself. If you are, then we will do the same and delete your e-mail. However, e-mail containing serious, intelligent inquiry will be answered. Please read the following steps if your are interested in learning and to schedule an appointment:1 - Contact me to inquire about classes via e-mail.2 - Potential students must wait for a reply e-mail from me with a 2 page application/assessment questionnaire attachment that they must fill in full and return.3 - Once I have received the e-mail back with the application, a phone interview will be scheduled4 - After the interview, each prospective student must wait for an invite and then I will give location of the training facility, plus a date and time for them to try their free trial class within the week4 - Each potential student must keep their appointment or contact me if they need to reschedule, If he/she does not show up and does not contact me to let me know that they cannot make it or are running late, they will NOT be given a second appointment.5-Trial students must bring comfortable workout/training clothes so that he or she can participate. I would prefer new students to participate in the class and I want to make sure that the atmosphere matches what the applicant's expectations are.ABOUT THE SCHOOLMy Wing Chun classes is quite different from the typical martial arts school. Located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, the students train in a semi-private environment and the emphasis is on quality rather than quantity. Because enrollment is limited, potential students must complete an application/assessment form that they receive from me, wait for an invite and demonstrate their diligence during their first six months probationary training period before being finally accepted. GOOD ATTENDANCE, DILIGENT EFFORT, and PROPER ATTITUDE are required to become accepted and remain a student. Joining requires commitment. If you want to train, you pay upfront. We don't sign contracts. You're either in or out. My resources are limited and the spirit and attitude of my classes will remain as it is, hence not everyone will fit in and not everyone will be accepted. Eligibility for long--term training will be decided through conversation and assessment. Those who are accepted will be thrown into the fire, to suffer, to grow, and become stronger mentally and physically, to change for the better.  WHAT IS WING CHUNWing Chun Kung Fu is a Chinese form of martial arts that was designed strictly for self-defense. It is the only martial art created and made famous by a woman. Ng Mui, the Shaolin nun who developed the system, realized that most of the techniques in Shaolin Kung Fu were useless for a small woman to use against a larger, stronger man. She also realized that a woman could not match a man's stamina in a long fight. With this in mind, she synthesized all of the martial arts she learned at the Shaolin Temple, discarding all flashy, flamboyant, wasted movement, into a very simple and direct fighting style that enabled a smaller, weaker person to defeat a larger, stronger person within a few seconds.Wing Chun first came to universal recognition with films such as Bruce Lee's "Enter the Dragon", as well as Sammo Hung's "Warriors Two" and "Prodigal Son". More recently, "IP Man" and "IP Man 2" starring Asian action star Donnie Yen, has sparked even more curiosity about this amazing fighting art.Wing Chun can be described in two words: simple and economical. The movements are fast and extremely efficient, utilizing subtle shifts, and body structure to develop power and speed. Kicks are usually low, swift, and can be used simultaneous with the hand techniques. Instead of blocking a strike by knocking it out of the way with muscular strength, attacks are redirected, using the least amount of motion and strength. Rather than pulling back or "winding up" to strike, attacks are quick and direct, and power is generated over short distances. Alternatively, while other systems block first and then attack, a Wing Chun student will train themselves to block and attack simultaneously. Contact is maintained with the opponent at all times, as the Wing Chun student is trained to be very comfortable in close range fighting.Due to the simplicity of Wing Chun, it can be used effectively by beginning students. At its most advanced, this simplicity is also what makes Wing Chun such a devastatingly efficient self defense system. You can also visit us at http://www.chocheung-wingchun.com

Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.  Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.His approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationaly as well as to those working abstractly. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of theentire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Richard Barrnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

You will probably discover a new and exciting way of looking at English! HERE'S WHAT SOME OF MY STUDENTS HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT ME: [Please note: All testimonials have been edited for grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc.] "I could never have imagined I would find such an enthusiastic, interesting, and wise person when I first contacted James. Meeting James has been a powerful experience for me, both in terms of my English and my life. He has been the most dedicated, patient, and efficient English teacher I have ever had. After two classes in Cambridge, we have continued on Skype. Never before have I improved so much in terms of conversation skills and in the understanding of the English language in all its aspects. With new techniques and different teaching approaches, he has found a way to engage me in the learning process and to make me desire and love every moment I spend surrounded by English. "This is not about spending hours in front of boring and inanimate books anymore and has become a complete, fun, and more intuitive process, in which we focus on those weaker aspects of my current knowledge as they come up. The teaching has been individualized based on the different aspects I lack. Besides that, learning doesn't finish every time James' face fades away on my computer screen at the end of our Skype classes. James sends interesting and well-structured materials for me to work with at home and has given me pieces of advice regarding different activities related to English that have helped me to improve at my own speed. Our classes are definitely worth every dollar I pay for them." -- Pablo, Spain "I had learned English for a long time before I met James, but I could not make a real leap in speaking English. I would strongly recommend James to those of you who seriously want to improve your English. In the time I have been working with him, first with classes in Cambridge and now from South Korea on Skype, my English skills have definitely improved. He helps his students in so many different ways and provides continual support that goes beyond the classroom. After I started working with James soon after I arrived in the U.S., he began to show me effective ways to advance my English to higher and higher levels. He also closely guided me. He is not an ordinary teacher, and his class is not just about learning grammar and expressions. His teaching methods are customized and have evolved depending on my progress. He has further helped me cultivate more natural American rhythms and accents, which no other teachers could do in the past. If you choose James, you will have a great teacher and maybe even a trusted friend at the same time!" -- Hessung, South Korea "I worked with James for over a year. He was not only an excellent English teacher but also a life coach who helped me to overcome challenges in my work and in my life. I really appreciate what he taught me over the time we worked together. You will get more than you expect when you learn English with James." -- Tiffany, Taiwan "After a long period of taking private lessons with my teacher and friend, James, I can say that he is the best teacher in the world! He not only seemed to have answers to everything, but was also able to maintain a high level of energy, creativity, and enthusiasm. He knew exactly what I needed, and he explained everything so amazingly well that I understood everything he taught me very quickly. I learned so much about English from James and also how to improve my English outside of class. The materials he created and the regular attention he gave me outside of class also helped me a lot. I really looked forward to going to his classes every week!" -- Amador, Spain "I sincerely recommend James, a wonderful teacher not only in English but also in life guidance, to all who seek to improve English skills and/or who are eager to understand American culture and history. James has incredible cultural sensitivity and intellectual diversity as well as passion and patience in teaching. I have benefited tremendously from James in accent reduction, speaking/listening comprehension, and presentation skills (just to name three areas) since we started classes a while back. I have heartfelt gratitude to James for his continuing energy in teaching and for guiding me in many aspects, levels, and stages of life." -- Ching-Fu, Taiwan "James is an extraordinary teacher, providing a professional teaching approach combined with a fun working atmosphere. He easily identified my weak spots and came up with an individual approach to address these issues and resolve them. He is very motivating, encouraging, creative, highly skilled, and energetic, offering not only English lessons but learning for life as well. I enjoyed this holistic approach, benefitting from a unique teaching material data base which he created all by himself and which is still available to me now, even after I have finished classes. He is simply a great teacher, which you need to experience for yourself. Words can't explain." -- Jrgen, Germany "Working with James was the best investment I made while I was in Boston for a year. When I arrived, I had a lot of problems speaking English. I also had major problems with pronunciation and grammar. When I started working with James, he immediately began to help me to prioritize my learning process. He also challenged me in the right way to reach my very high goals. I felt that James helped me every second I was with him, and even when I was not in private class with him! When I had to prepare for presentations for my professional work, James gave me very valuable tips that made a big difference. He has a lot of experience in public speaking. Definitively, I can say that I got a big return on my investment. Now that I am back in Spain, I still work with James -- on Skype!" -- Ignacio, Spain Rates for One-on-One Private Lessons: $65/hour $105/two-hour session (You will receive a LOWER RATE for prepaid lessons scheduled in advance. Longer sessions available. Both in-person and Skype classes are intensive, so the rates are the same.) I HAVE BEEN TEACHING STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS ESL ENGLISH SINCE 1997, and I have a three-page resume, which includes other teaching and work experience. In addition, I have a lot of life experience. Please contact me now to arrange a FREE  CONSULTATION on Skype. (I would also like to send you a link to my website.) It will be my honor to serve you!

Richard Barnet has his own approach to drawing and figure constructionThis can be useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. The interplay between imagination and observation is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements He demonstrates contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationaly as well as to those working abstractly. Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists.  As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       I am currently offering classes in Wing Chun Kung-Fu in Midtown Manhattan. Because of the private/semi-private training environment and limited space, enrollment is extremely limited. In addition, because of the seriousness of the training, anyone inquiring must be over 18 years old to apply, SORRY NO EXCEPTIONS. Everyone will be carefully screened through an initial interview and then placed in a six-month probationary training period before being accepted. I am looking for serious, non-egotistical, dedicated individuals who are willing to devote themselves and put in 100% effort in their training. I have been studying Wing Chun under Sifu Michael Militano for over 20 years, training under him consistently since March 1993. Class schedule is as follows:Monday 6:00pm - 7:00pmWednesday 6:00pm - 7:00pmSaturday 12:00pm - 1:00pmSunday 2:00pm - 3:00pmThere are no contracts to sign, classes are $150 a monthAnyone interested can contact me using the e-mail address above to schedule an appointment to try your first class or if you need more information. Responding with an intelligent, honest and caring reply takes time and energy. We don't like to waste either. Before clicking on the link above, please ask yourself (and answer honestly) whether you are planning to ask a question that you can answer yourself. If you are, then we will do the same and delete your e-mail. However, e-mail containing serious, intelligent inquiry will be answered. Please read the following steps if your are interested in learning and to schedule an appointment:1 - Contact me to inquire about classes via e-mail.2 - Potential students must wait for a reply e-mail from me with a 2 page application/assessment questionnaire attachment that they must fill in full and return.3 - Once I have received the e-mail back with the application, a phone interview will be scheduled4 - After the interview, each prospective student must wait for an invite and then I will give location of the training facility, plus a date and time for them to try their free trial class within the week4 - Each potential student must keep their appointment or contact me if they need to reschedule, If he/she does not show up and does not contact me to let me know that they cannot make it or are running late, they will NOT be given a second appointment.5-Trial students must bring comfortable workout/training clothes so that he or she can participate. I would prefer new students to participate in the class and I want to make sure that the atmosphere matches what the applicant's expectations are.ABOUT THE SCHOOLMy Wing Chun classes is quite different from the typical martial arts school. Located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, the students train in a semi-private environment and the emphasis is on quality rather than quantity. Because enrollment is limited, potential students must complete an application/assessment form that they receive from me, wait for an invite and demonstrate their diligence during their first six months probationary training period before being finally accepted. GOOD ATTENDANCE, DILIGENT EFFORT, and PROPER ATTITUDE are required to become accepted and remain a student. Joining requires commitment. If you want to train, you pay upfront. We don't sign contracts. You're either in or out. My resources are limited and the spirit and attitude of my classes will remain as it is, hence not everyone will fit in and not everyone will be accepted. Eligibility for long--term training will be decided through conversation and assessment. Those who are accepted will be thrown into the fire, to suffer, to grow, and become stronger mentally and physically, to change for the better.  WHAT IS WING CHUNWing Chun Kung Fu is a Chinese form of martial arts that was designed strictly for self-defense. It is the only martial art created and made famous by a woman. Ng Mui, the Shaolin nun who developed the system, realized that most of the techniques in Shaolin Kung Fu were useless for a small woman to use against a larger, stronger man. She also realized that a woman could not match a man's stamina in a long fight. With this in mind, she synthesized all of the martial arts she learned at the Shaolin Temple, discarding all flashy, flamboyant, wasted movement, into a very simple and direct fighting style that enabled a smaller, weaker person to defeat a larger, stronger person within a few seconds.Wing Chun first came to universal recognition with films such as Bruce Lee's "Enter the Dragon", as well as Sammo Hung's "Warriors Two" and "Prodigal Son". More recently, "IP Man" and "IP Man 2" starring Asian action star Donnie Yen, has sparked even more curiosity about this amazing fighting art.Wing Chun can be described in two words: simple and economical. The movements are fast and extremely efficient, utilizing subtle shifts, and body structure to develop power and speed. Kicks are usually low, swift, and can be used simultaneous with the hand techniques. Instead of blocking a strike by knocking it out of the way with muscular strength, attacks are redirected, using the least amount of motion and strength. Rather than pulling back or "winding up" to strike, attacks are quick and direct, and power is generated over short distances. Alternatively, while other systems block first and then attack, a Wing Chun student will train themselves to block and attack simultaneously. Contact is maintained with the opponent at all times, as the Wing Chun student is trained to be very comfortable in close range fighting.Due to the simplicity of Wing Chun, it can be used effectively by beginning students. At its most advanced, this simplicity is also what makes Wing Chun such a devastatingly efficient self defense system. You can also visit us at http://www.chocheung-wingchun.com

description=                                                       RICHARD BARNET - On Good Figure DrawingAs both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.  Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.His approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationaly as well as to those working abstractly. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of theentire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Barnet encourages students to explore working in anatomical drawing, sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working traditionally, as well as to those working abstractly.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.Mr. Barnet has taught at New York University, the Art Students League of New York, and at the College of Mount St. Vincent. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Richard Barnet understands it.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.View more info at Richard Barnet - http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       Drawing as Anatomy with RICHARD BARNET The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing.   Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

You will have to drastically cut out sugars and starches by eating a food plan that is similar to the first phase of the Atkins diet.  That means you might have to cook a bit more or eat different kinds of foods at restaurants than you eat now.  Why?  The program is built on years of clinical research that suggest that these approaches can help get your blood glucose under control and lose weight.  It includes video-based classes, handouts, recipes, and support for psychological well-being, mindful eating, exercise, and sleep.  It was developed by a team of doctors and researchers at UCSF using the latest research on behavior change and health.  Think about sustaining these habits over 16 weeks / 4 months.  Are you willing to do this?  If so, please fill out the screening survey to see if you are eligible at: http://ucbpsych.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_9LXQ9BJvMR1QcbbThere is no cost for participation and you will receive a free scale and your HbA1c results for free.Thanks and best wishes!

Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing. Mr. Barnet has taught Anatomy and Drawing at the Art Students League of New York since 1980. He currently teaches there as well.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Learn the fundamentals of anatomy, proportion, line, chroma, and tonal values. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media.Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

This way you will build the foundation of your website at incredible speed.You'll use the features you learn here in literally every website you build in the future. Examples include: creating users, storing images, basic web design, and a lot more.During the 2nd week, you will build the most creative parts of your website. This requires more one-on-one time than the 1st week. So instead of following videos, you will work directly with your mentor and a small team of hard-working students like you.(Advanced students can skip the first week of tutorials and start working directly with a programming mentor on their project's toughest features.)YOU decide what to build. If you want to learn data visualization, your mentor will teach you data visualization. If you want to accept payments, your mentor will teach you that. We value focus above everything else at HackErupt and we'll never try to make you learn something you don't need.Each week requires on average 10-20 hours of commitment. If you don't have 10-20 hours each week, that's okay - but it may take you a little longer.First 5 sign ups win a FREE 2-hour programming mentoring session.

He teaches the  fundamentals of anatomy, proportion, line, color chroma and tonal values.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly.As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.

The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980, Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

He encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.  In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Barnet encourages students to explore working in anatomical drawing, sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.Mr. Barnet has taught at New York University, the Art Students League of New York, and at the College of Mount St. Vincent. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Richard Barnet understands it.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.View more info at Richard Barnet - http://www.richardbarnet.net

Enjoy valuable tips, photo opportunities and giveaways. WHEN: Saturday, July 14, 2012 10:00 AM12:00 Noon  WHERE: Jefferson Recreation Center 2205 First Avenue, Corner of 113th StreetDETAILS: Jorge Bendersky became a celebrity dog groomer soon after moving to Manhattan from his native Argentina. Trimming and fluffing the four-legged children of some of the New York City's elite. Today he is one of Manhattan's most sought-after groomer. His clients include top models, notable actors, infamous billionaires and popular recording artists. Jorge's talents have been seen on Animal Planet's reality show, "The Groomer Has It", as a Judge on TLC's Extreme Poodles and as the new Grooming expert on Animal Planet's Dogs 101. Jorges deep commitment to giving back has led him to offer his talents to help dogs who need the most just to survive; through a series of pet care workshops in NYCs inner-city neighborhoods and by conducting seminars to help other groomers carry on this mission. Jorge believes that something as simple as knowing how to properly brush your dog is one of the most important tools on early detection of a wide spectrum of dogs potential diseases, this early detection helps pet owners to ensure their pets health and at the same time saving money on vet bills. Unfortunately, astronomical vet bills are one of the reasons dogs are surrender to shelters, adding to the number of dogs euthanized every year. Accordingly, knowing how to brush them, does save dogs lives! Please learn more at www.planetjorge.com. ###
