Richard Barnet has his own approach to drawing and figure constructionThis can be useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. The interplay between imagination and observation is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements He demonstrates contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

I know what its like to have a paralyzing fear of something (ask me about my first deep water scuba experience..its not pretty.) BUT what that experience has taught me is how UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT it is to have someone who is KNOWLEDGEABLE, PATIENT, compassionate and understanding of what I NEED to move past my fears. I know I can help YOU or your child get in the pool and learn how to swim, because I have been in your shoes before and I know how exactly what to do to teach you to move through it!As a female certified Water Safety Swim Instructor/Lifeguard, with more than 8 years of experience of teaching from the Y, I have taught hundreds of beginners how to swim at their own pace! My simple and gentle teaching approach is guaranteed to get the average or non swimmer of any age to learn how to swim by moving past fear to build confidence in the water and learn efficient stroke technique , which will grant lifetime access to health benefits such as recreational swim and low-impact exercise.After taking lessons with me I can guarantee you or your child/teen will walk away with 3 important lessons:Stroke improvement and development. Personal Growth: In learning new skills students build self-esteem and the consequences of their/your choices in relation to water safety.Knowledge of personal water safety- The basis of accident prevention. One of my past clients shares her experience: "I give Amanda all the credit for teaching my 3 and 5 year old daughters to swim!! Both my children took private swim lessons with Amanda and not only learned to swim but also built their confidence in the water. Amanda is caring and sweet and my kids love her. Even more important than that, Amanda devotes all of her attention and energy on her students. Whenever my children were in the water with Amanda, she focused on them. I felt completely safe and comfortable with them in her care. I highly recommend Amanda as an excellent, responsible and educated swim instructor! -- Alyse D.Interested?!

description=                                                       I whole heartedly know that anyone has the potential and ability to change at any time in their life, regardless of your age or the events that have happened in the past. You are more than your story.It is a joy working with people and I understand that working with one to guide them towards change is a deeply personal relationship. In our sessions we will primarily focus in inner inquiry to work together in exploring and understanding the relationship that exists between your thoughts, feelings and the resulting actions that arise because of them. Once the understanding of the connection is clear we can begin to shift perspectives and implement concepts that result in a more integrated, fulfilled and peaceful life, helping you understand how your very thoughts can imprison you and also set you free.What do people seek to address in their sessions? There are a number of reasons why one engages in a counseling session. A great deal of the time, people are looking for a deeper sense of inner peace. However, a person may be trying to understand and overcome one or more issues that are afflicting them in their day to day life. There may be limiting beliefs that need to be addressed. One may be looking for perspective on how to better communicate with others. They may also feel the need to address questions related directly or indirectly to their belief system. A feeling of emptiness with life and a lack of direction or purpose often give way to profound questions that are existential in nature. Some people are at a pivotal move from one stage of their life to another, there could be an underlying resistance that needs to be explored. Traumatic experiences can impact in a person deeply and require to be addressed so that it does not set deeper roots in the psyche. At times, one may just feel that they want to better understand themselves and their relationship to others.

Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationaly as well as to those working abstractly.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       Drawing as Anatomy with RICHARD BARNET The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing.   Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

A great deal of the time, people are looking for a deeper sense of inner peace. However, a person may be trying to understand and overcome one or more issues that are afflicting them in their day to day life. There may be limiting beliefs that need to be addressed. One may be looking for perspective on how to better communicate with others. They may also feel the need to address questions related directly or indirectly to their belief system. A feeling of emptiness with life and a lack of direction or purpose often give way to profound questions that are existential in nature. Some people are at a pivotal move from one stage of their life to another, there could be an underlying resistance that needs to be explored. Traumatic experiences can impact in a person deeply and require to be addressed so that it does not set deeper roots in the psyche. At times, one may just feel that they want to better understand themselves and their relationship to others.The counseling sessions are for the purpose of gaining greater insight into who you are and your relationship with the world around you. What is expressed is both the great possibilities and the extraordinary that is found within. My interest is in guiding and assisting those that have a sincere desire in bringing about awareness to their nature and embodying that which they truly are. Guidance is offered in:        Sustained inner peace.       Cease mental suffering.       Overcome mental blocks and limited beliefs.       Addressing the root causes of stress and anxiety by understanding old thought        patterns and shifting perception in order to transform them into balanced, stress                free, and empowered emotions.       Better communication.       Realizing your lifes purpose.       The understanding of how to meditate and implement guided imagery techniques.        A recognition of the mind and bodys way of intelligently communicating.       A greater understanding of existence and one's relationship to the surrounding world.       How to make a distinction between what one does and is and create balance.       A deeper Insight into recognizing the self-construct and how to go beyond it. These are just a few examples. However, you are welcome to bring up any type of issues that you desire to talk about, need support, or clarity with and be guided with absolute confidentiality, wisdom and compassion.Please visit www.EricErrera.com for more information.

description=                                                       RICHARD BARNET - Instructor of Figure Drawing and AnatomyGood figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.  As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationaly as well as to those working abstractly.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

I know what its like to have a paralyzing fear of something (ask me about my first deep water scuba experience..its not pretty.) BUT what that experience has taught me is how UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT it is to have someone who is KNOWLEDGEABLE, PATIENT, compassionate and understanding of what I NEED to move past my fears. I know I can help YOU or your child get in the pool and learn how to swim, because I have been in your shoes before and I know how exactly what to do to teach you to move through it!As a female certified Water Safety Swim Instructor/Lifeguard, with more than 8 years of experience of teaching from the Y, I have taught hundreds of beginners how to swim at their own pace! My simple and gentle teaching approach is guaranteed to get the average or non swimmer of any age to learn how to swim by moving past fear to build confidence in the water and learn efficient stroke technique , which will grant lifetime access to health benefits such as recreational swim and low-impact exercise.After taking lessons with me I can guarantee you or your child/teen will walk away with 3 important lessons:Stroke improvement and development. Personal Growth: In learning new skills students build self-esteem and the consequences of their/your choices in relation to water safety.Knowledge of personal water safety- The basis of accident prevention. One of my past clients shares her experience: "I give Amanda all the credit for teaching my 3 and 5 year old daughters to swim!! Both my children took private swim lessons with Amanda and not only learned to swim but also built their confidence in the water. Amanda is caring and sweet and my kids love her. Even more important than that, Amanda devotes all of her attention and energy on her students. Whenever my children were in the water with Amanda, she focused on them. I felt completely safe and comfortable with them in her care. I highly recommend Amanda as an excellent, responsible and educated swim instructor! -- Alyse D.Interested?!

description=                                                       I whole heartedly know that anyone has the potential and ability to change at any time in their life, regardless of your age or the events that have happened in the past. You are more than your story.It is a joy working with people and I understand that working with one to guide them towards change is a deeply personal relationship. In our sessions we will primarily focus in inner inquiry to work together in exploring and understanding the relationship that exists between your thoughts, feelings and the resulting actions that arise because of them. Once the understanding of the connection is clear we can begin to shift perspectives and implement concepts that result in a more integrated, fulfilled and peaceful life, helping you understand how your very thoughts can imprison you and also set you free.What do people seek to address in their sessions? There are a number of reasons why one engages in a counseling session. A great deal of the time, people are looking for a deeper sense of inner peace. However, a person may be trying to understand and overcome one or more issues that are afflicting them in their day to day life. There may be limiting beliefs that need to be addressed. One may be looking for perspective on how to better communicate with others. They may also feel the need to address questions related directly or indirectly to their belief system. A feeling of emptiness with life and a lack of direction or purpose often give way to profound questions that are existential in nature. Some people are at a pivotal move from one stage of their life to another, there could be an underlying resistance that needs to be explored. Traumatic experiences can impact in a person deeply and require to be addressed so that it does not set deeper roots in the psyche. At times, one may just feel that they want to better understand themselves and their relationship to others. The counseling sessions are for the purpose of gaining greater insight into who you are and your relationship with the world around you. What is expressed is both the great possibilities and the extraordinary that is found within. My interest is in guiding and assisting those that have a sincere desire in bringing about awareness to their nature and embodying that which they truly are. These are just a few examples. However, you are welcome to bring up any type of issues that you desire to talk about, need support, or clarity with and be guided with absolute confidentiality, wisdom and compassion.Please visit www.EricErrera.com for more information or send me a direct message to set up a 30 minute introduction call. We can get acquainted with each other and briefly discuss what is on your mind. Ill answer any initial questions that you may have, and youll be given the opportunity to present me with your current challenges and the type of changes or goals you would like to see.This exploratory call is free, with no obligation.Regards,Eric

Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationaly as well as to those working abstractly.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       Drawing as Anatomy with RICHARD BARNET The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing.   Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       RICHARD BARNET - On Good Figure DrawingAs both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.  Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

A great deal of the time, people are looking for a deeper sense of inner peace. However, a person may be trying to understand and overcome one or more issues that are afflicting them in their day to day life. There may be limiting beliefs that need to be addressed. One may be looking for perspective on how to better communicate with others. They may also feel the need to address questions related directly or indirectly to their belief system. A feeling of emptiness with life and a lack of direction or purpose often give way to profound questions that are existential in nature. Some people are at a pivotal move from one stage of their life to another, there could be an underlying resistance that needs to be explored. Traumatic experiences can impact in a person deeply and require to be addressed so that it does not set deeper roots in the psyche. At times, one may just feel that they want to better understand themselves and their relationship to others.The counseling sessions are for the purpose of gaining greater insight into who you are and your relationship with the world around you. What is expressed is both the great possibilities and the extraordinary that is found within. My interest is in guiding and assisting those that have a sincere desire in bringing about awareness to their nature and embodying that which they truly are. Guidance is offered in:        Sustained inner peace.       Cease mental suffering.       Overcome mental blocks and limited beliefs.       Addressing the root causes of stress and anxiety by understanding old thought        patterns and shifting perception in order to transform them into balanced, stress                free, and empowered emotions.       Better communication.       Realizing your lifes purpose.       The understanding of how to meditate and implement guided imagery techniques.        A recognition of the mind and bodys way of intelligently communicating.       A greater understanding of existence and one's relationship to the surrounding world.       How to make a distinction between what one does and is and create balance.       A deeper Insight into recognizing the self-construct and how to go beyond it. These are just a few examples. However, you are welcome to bring up any type of issues that you desire to talk about, need support, or clarity with and be guided with absolute confidentiality, wisdom and compassion.Please visit www.EricErrera.com for more information.

description=                                                       RICHARD BARNET - Instructor of Figure Drawing and AnatomyGood figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.  As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationaly as well as to those working abstractly.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Barnet encourages students to explore working in anatomical drawing, sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working traditionally, as well as to those working abstractly.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.Mr. Barnet has taught at New York University, the Art Students League of New York, and at the College of Mount St. Vincent. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Richard Barnet understands it.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.View more info at Richard Barnet - http://www.richardbarnet.net

Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing. Mr. Barnet has taught Anatomy and Drawing at the Art Students League of New York since 1980. He currently teaches there as well.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       The experience of outward events can undoubtedly affect a person and cause pain. However, things are not always what they appear to be. The suffering that apparently follows as a result of pain is not a necessary fact of life, it is a state of mind. Suffering is a result of your way of taking in and responding to an event. Any event that happens, derives its meaning once one takes it in the way that they do. Whether you suffer or not depends entirely on your reaction to that situation in that moment and the time that follows. Certain habits of thinking, and the beliefs, feelings and behaviors that follow, can make it challenging to see clearly and remain balanced. Please visit my page at www.EricErrera.com to learn more about my work. You are welcome to send an e mail or set up an introduction call where we can get acquainted and you may discuss what is on your mind.

Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists,Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980, and at the College of Mount St. Vincent since 1970 He has also taught at New York University, State University of New York at Purchase, Upsala College, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.View more about drawing instruction at ASL with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       Illustrated Lectures on ANATOMY by Richard BarnetIn most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.newyorkartworld.com/gallery/barnet.richard.html

description=                                                       Counseling generally refers to a service where a person provides advice or guidance to another person or group. Spiritual counseling refers to such a service when the advice or guidance provided is based on spiritual principles. This does not have to be associated with a major or organized religion. The focus could simply involve connecting the benefits of spirituality with the improvements that a person wants to see in his/her life, as the laws in which govern existence are the same for all. People generally seek counseling for one of two reasons. Either, a person may be trying to overcome an issue, which can include depression, anxiety, limiting beliefs, abuse, a lack of purpose, and so forth. Or, the person may want to make some type of change or improvement. This could include career advancement or spiritual development through inner-inquiry. In either of these situations, counseling is often a resource that provides guidance and assistance in recognizing obstacles. The spiritual counseling offered is non-denominational. This means that it does not subscribe to or encourage or have any affiliation to the philosophies of any particular religion. Personal guidance is offered to individuals who follow a particular religion without imposing on or violating their beliefs. In realizing the connection between one's self and a greater force within, a great shift in perspective and power becomes apparent. Counseling can be significant in helping a person to grow and understand themselves and their relationship with existence in ways that were previously found difficult or impossible. This includes issues such as those caused by bad relationships. Spiritual counseling always explains the extent in which one is responsible to take action, and what is not within their ability to alter, lend clarity and to understand a grander vantage point. There are numerous ways that a person can receive spiritual counseling. Sessions are offered via Skype video conference, phone, private meetings, and workshops. Please visit www.EricErrera.com for more information. Send a message in regards to any questions you have or if would like to set up a session.

Learn the fundamentals of anatomy, proportion, line, chroma, and tonal values. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media.Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

He teaches the  fundamentals of anatomy, proportion, line, color chroma and tonal values.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly.As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure.

description=                                                       RICHARD BARNET - Figurative Drawing and Anatomy PresentationRichard Barnet, Draughtsman, Watercolorist, and Sculptor is a master in many mediums. He encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly.Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it.  In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

description=                                                       DRAWING and Anatomy Lessons with Richard BarnetThe interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Richard Barnet understands it. His approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.He surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Mr. Barnet has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1980, and at the College of Mount St. Vincent since 1970 View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. Richard Barnet's approach to drawing and figure construction is useful to artists working representationally as well as to those working abstractly. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for artists creating the human figure, whether from direct observation of models or from imagination. Good figure drawing is composed of such elements as contour, linear perspective, and modeling form in light and shade.In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net

The interplay between observation and imagination is at the heart of anatomy for artists, as Mr. Barnet understands it. In most classes, he gives an illustrated lecture acquainting students with the elements of drawing. Over many classes he surveys the anatomy of the entire human figure. As both a sculptor and a watercolor painter, Mr. Barnet encourages students to explore working in sculpture, paint and other media. Such work is often a natural extension or consequence of drawing.Richard Barnet teaches drawing at the Art Students League of NY.View more about drawing with Richard Barnet at: http://www.richardbarnet.net
